# Predictions for Human Resources

In this case study I predicted if an employee is willing (or probable) to leave the company.
Here I performed data exploration, visualization and cleaning. Then different methods were applied to predict a target variable:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Random Forest
 - Deep Learning (artificial neural network)

The results are the following:
 - Logistic Regression with ~91% of accuracy
 - Random Forest with ~89% of accuracy
 - Deep Learning with ~88% of accuracy
